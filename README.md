This project was created in order to help Avrios employees find local block parties. This is achieved by using the SimpleSearch API that fetches data from the Berlin Open Data website. The data is further filtered based on the user responses. In order to access the project, use the following link: https://nazaryaremko.github.io/BlockPartySearch/

The code was written and debugged using VS Code. To continue working on this project, install VS Code, CD into the directory of this project and use the 'Go Live' function.
